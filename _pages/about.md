I am a second year PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) (previously, Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms), advised by [Dr. Liam Paull](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpaull/). My interests are diverse; predominantly along the intersections of robotics, computer vision, deep learning, and computer graphics.

At present, I devote most of my time to develop techniques that enable embodied agents _to not just see, but to understand_. Vision sensors only inform a _robot_ information about what is visible to them. However, perception algorithms must be able to leverage prior information about how the world works, to truly understand their environment. This is the hypothesis/motivation that most of my research hinges on. My work spans generative 3D modeling, scene understanding, SLAM, and perception for autonomous driving.

When I'm not doing research, I love to spend time writing technical blogs, tutorials, and open-source code.
