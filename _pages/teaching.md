During my time as a Masters' student at IIIT Hyderabad, I had the wonderful opporunity of teaching a significant subset of topics for the following courses.

* Robot Vision - Monsoon 2017 - IIIT Hyderabad
* Mobile Robotics - Monsoon 2016 - IIIT Hyderabad

## Scribed Notes for Mobile Robotics - Monsoon 2016

Here is a collection of scribed notes compiled by me and some of the students who took the Mobile Robotics class in the Monsoon 2016 semester. The course was taught by Prof. K. Madhava Krishna, myself, and Bharath Gopalakrishnan.
